  <h1>Egg Chow Mein Recipe!</h1>
  <!-- Intro -->
  <p>
	<b>What is Biryani?</b> I can't describe it with words. It is emotion. It is something 
	that can can bring a smile on face in any situation.<br /><br/>Well if you ask google, 
	it would say It is made with Indian spices, rice, meat (chicken, beef, goat, pork, lamb, 
	prawn, or fish), vegetables or eggs. The word 'biryani' is derived from a Persian word, 
	birian, which means fried before cooking. It is one of the most popular dishes, which has 
	acquired a niche for itself in South Asian cuisine.
